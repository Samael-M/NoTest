TODO:
    Timer   - Retest timer after changes
            - add different timer 'going off' methods. Send DM, @User message in chat or audio


I'm not entirely sure if I want to do this, but maybe. The idea is a sort of time sheet so you can 'clock in' and out of 'work'.
feature ideas
    - Various task/types of work that you could clock into
    - Store each users time sheets
    - Users in a server could look at the timesheets of other users to see how much time they've spent and on what task

/clockin                | clock into task, or create new task
    option: taskname
    subcommands:
    create task


/clockout               | clock out
/review                 | get info on timesheet of a user
    option: User

What would this require?
Creating/Reading/Writing local files to track User data.
