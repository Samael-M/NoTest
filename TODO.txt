TODO:
    Timer   - implement stopwatch
            - implement time remaining command
            - Resume tells you how much time is left
            - Intelligetly break time down into hours, minutes and seconds (from a large number in miliseconds)
            - How should the timer going off work? Currently when you set a timer, the bot joins a voice channel and will
            sound off a audible alarm. Because it was designed this way, I have the cancel timer command disconnect the bot from 
            any voice channel. Both set and resume timer check if it's in an active channel, and if not, stop the timer. 

            BUT, maybe I want the alarm to just be a DM or a message in the channel, without the bot every joining a voice channel.
            - Do we want the new timer to automaticall override old?
